# Scroll

### What's this all about?

Scroll is a project we started to help other people just like us to remember, recall, and revise the concepts of programming. We have included explanations regarding general algorithms and data structure that a computer science student may find useful, including its explanations and implementations in [Python and C++](https://piyushdeshmukh.github.io/scroll/start.html). But all of this can be generally found elsewhere on the Internet. However, we have made sure to include all the small tips and tricks that one should be aware of while dealing with a particular algorithm or the data structure.

Hope you find this collection useful. Happy coding...

### How can I contribute?

Programming a vast topic, and we know that we can't cover each and every data structure or algorithm that we have came across during the lifelong learning process. So we are more than happy to get your help. You may contribute to this collection either by
* Point out a mistake in the existing content, or if the language is literally ambiguous or if there are some bugs in the code.
* Get a new topic onto the list if it already not present.
* You know some hack through the algorithm or there is a point that should always be taken care of when implementing xyz data structure to which people are likely to fall into trap.

### How I should not mess up!

I know you are helping and have no intentions to get the content spoiled, but please refrain yourself from doing the following
* Simply changing the language of the description and keeping the content same. Although this may be considered if the original author wasn't really good at English and you were working with him to help.
* Do not add a new algorithm page unless it does not sound similar to one of the already included ones. Like we think it's not inappropriate to not to include Ternary search when we have Binary search on the list.
